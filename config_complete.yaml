# This file contains a configuration for the Honeycomb Refinery. It is in YAML
# format, organized into named groups, each of which contains a set of
# configuration values. Text preceded by two comment characters (##) is
# informational only. Text preceded by a single comment character (#) indicates
# a value that is commented out and not used; it should be uncommented to enable
# it.


###########################
## General Configuration ##
###########################
General:
  ## General contains general configuration options that apply to the
  ## entire Refinery process.
  ####
    ## ConfigurationVersion is the file format of this particular
    ## configuration file.
    ##
    ## This file is version 2.
    ## This field is required. It exists to allow the configuration system to
    ## adapt to future changes in the configuration file format.
    ##
    ## default: 2
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    ConfigurationVersion: 2

    ## MinRefineryVersion is the minimum version of Refinery that can load
    ## this configuration file.
    ##
    ## This setting specifies the lowest Refinery version capable of loading
    ## all of the features used in this file. If this value is present, then
    ## Refinery will refuse to start if its version is less than this
    ## setting.
    ##
    ## default: v2.0
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    MinRefineryVersion: v2.0

    ## DatasetPrefix is a prefix that can be used to distinguish a dataset
    ## from an environment in the rules.
    ##
    ## If telemetry is being sent to both a classic dataset and a new
    ## environment called the same thing, such as `production`, then this
    ## parameter can be used to distinguish these cases. When Refinery
    ## receives telemetry using an API key associated with a Honeycomb
    ## Classic dataset, it will then use the prefix in the form `{prefix}.
    ## {dataset}` when trying to resolve the rules definition.
    ##
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # DatasetPrefix: ""

    ## ConfigReloadInterval is the average interval between attempts at
    ## reloading the configuration file.
    ##
    ## Refinery will attempt to read its configuration and check for changes
    ## at approximately this interval. This time is varied by a random amount
    ## up to 10% to avoid all instances refreshing together. In installations
    ## where configuration changes are handled by restarting Refinery, which
    ## is often the case when using Kubernetes, disable this feature with a
    ## value of `0s`. As of Refinery v2.7, news of a configuration change is
    ## immediately propagated to all peers, and they will attempt to reload
    ## their configurations. Note that external factors (for example,
    ## Kubernetes ConfigMaps) may cause delays in propagating configuration
    ## changes.
    ##
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "15s".
    ## default: 15s
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # ConfigReloadInterval: 15s

###########################
## Network Configuration ##
###########################
Network:
  ## Network contains network configuration options.
  ####
    ## ListenAddr is the address where Refinery listens for incoming
    ## requests.
    ##
    ## This setting is the IP and port on which Refinery listens for incoming
    ## HTTP requests. These requests include traffic formatted as Honeycomb
    ## events, proxied requests to the Honeycomb API, and OpenTelemetry data
    ## using the `http` protocol. Incoming traffic is expected to be HTTP, so
    ## if SSL is a requirement, put something like `nginx` in front to do the
    ## decryption.
    ##
    ## Should be an ip:port like "0.0.0.0:8080".
    ## default: 0.0.0.0:8080
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # ListenAddr: "0.0.0.0:8080"

    ## PeerListenAddr is the IP and port on which to listen for traffic being
    ## rerouted from a peer.
    ##
    ## Incoming traffic is expected to be HTTP, so if using SSL use something
    ## like nginx or a load balancer to do the decryption.
    ##
    ## Should be an ip:port like "0.0.0.0:8081".
    ## default: 0.0.0.0:8081
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # PeerListenAddr: "0.0.0.0:8081"

    ## HTTPIdleTimeout is the duration the http server waits for activity on
    ## the connection.
    ##
    ## This is the amount of time after which if the http server does not see
    ## any activity, then it pings the client to see if the transport is
    ## still alive. "0s" means no timeout.
    ##
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "0s".
    ## default: 0s
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # HTTPIdleTimeout: 0s

    ## HoneycombAPI is the URL of the upstream Honeycomb API where the data
    ## will be sent.
    ##
    ## This setting is the destination to which Refinery sends all events
    ## that it decides to keep.
    ##
    ## default: https://api.honeycomb.io
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # HoneycombAPI: "https://api.honeycomb.io"

##############################
## Access Key Configuration ##
##############################
AccessKeys:
  ## AccessKeys contains access keys -- API keys that the proxy will treat
  ## specially, and other flags that control how the proxy handles API
  ## keys.
  ##
  ####
    ## ReceiveKeys is a set of Honeycomb API keys that the proxy will treat
    ## specially.
    ##
    ## This list only applies to span traffic - other Honeycomb API actions
    ## will be proxied through to the upstream API directly without modifying
    ## keys.
    ##
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # ReceiveKeys:
      # - your-key-goes-here

    ## AcceptOnlyListedKeys is a boolean flag that causes events arriving
    ## with API keys not in the `ReceiveKeys` list to be rejected.
    ##
    ## If `true`, then only traffic using the keys listed in `ReceiveKeys` is
    ## accepted. Events arriving with API keys not in the `ReceiveKeys` list
    ## will be rejected with an HTTP `401` error.
    ## If `false`, then all traffic is accepted and `ReceiveKeys` is ignored.
    ## This setting is applied **before** the `SendKey` and `SendKeyMode`
    ## settings.
    ##
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # AcceptOnlyListedKeys: false

    ## SendKey is an optional Honeycomb API key that Refinery can use to send
    ## data to Honeycomb, depending on configuration.
    ##
    ## If `SendKey` is set to a valid Honeycomb key, then Refinery can use
    ## the listed key to send data. The exact behavior depends on the value
    ## of `SendKeyMode`.
    ##
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # SendKey: ""

    ## SendKeyMode controls how SendKey is used to replace or augment API
    ## keys used in incoming telemetry.
    ##
    ## Controls how SendKey is used to replace or supply API keys used in
    ## incoming telemetry. If `AcceptOnlyListedKeys` is `true`, then
    ## `SendKeys` will only be used for events with keys listed in
    ## `ReceiveKeys`.
    ## `none` uses the incoming key for all telemetry (default). `all`
    ## overwrites all keys, even missing ones, with `SendKey`. `nonblank`
    ## overwrites all supplied keys but will not inject `SendKey` if the
    ## incoming key is blank. `listedonly` overwrites only the keys listed in
    ## `ReceiveKeys`. `unlisted` uses the `SendKey` for all events *except*
    ## those with keys listed in `ReceiveKeys`, which use their original
    ## keys. `missingonly` uses the SendKey only to inject keys into events
    ## with blank keys. All other events use their original keys.
    ##

########################
## Refinery Telemetry ##
########################
RefineryTelemetry:
  ## RefineryTelemetry contains configuration information for the telemetry
  ## that Refinery uses to record its own operation.
  ####
    ## AddRuleReasonToTrace controls whether to decorate traces with Refinery
    ## rule evaluation results.
    ##
    ## When enabled, this setting causes traces that are sent to Honeycomb to
    ## include the field `meta.refinery.reason`. This field contains text
    ## indicating which rule was evaluated that caused the trace to be
    ## included.
    ## This setting also includes the field `meta.refinery.send_reason`,
    ## which contains the reason that the trace was sent. Possible values of
    ## this field are `trace_send_got_root`, which means that the root span
    ## arrived; `trace_send_expired`, which means that `TraceTimeout` was
    ## reached; `trace_send_ejected_full`, which means that the trace cache
    ## was full; and `trace_send_ejected_memsize`, which means that Refinery
    ## was out of memory.
    ## These names are also the names of metrics that Refinery tracks.
    ## We recommend enabling this setting whenever a rules-based sampler is
    ## in use, as it is useful for debugging and understanding the behavior
    ## of your Refinery installation.
    ##
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # AddRuleReasonToTrace: false

    ## AddSpanCountToRoot controls whether to add a metadata field to root
    ## spans that indicates the number of child elements in a trace.
    ##
    ## The added metadata field, `meta.span_count`, indicates the number of
    ## child elements on the trace at the time the sampling decision was
    ## made. This value is available to the rules-based sampler, making it
    ## possible to write rules that are dependent upon the number of spans,
    ## span events, and span links in the trace. If `true` and
    ## `AddCountsToRoot` is set to false, then Refinery will add
    ## `meta.span_count` to the root span.
    ##
    ## default: true
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # AddSpanCountToRoot: true

    ## AddCountsToRoot controls whether to add metadata fields to root spans
    ## that indicates the number of child spans, span events, span links, and
    ## honeycomb events.
    ##
    ## If `true`, then Refinery will ignore the `AddSpanCountToRoot` setting
    ## and add the following fields to the root span based on the values at
    ## the time the sampling decision was made:
    ## - `meta.span_count`: the number of child spans on the trace
    ## - `meta.span_event_count`: the number of span events on the trace
    ## - `meta.span_link_count`: the number of span links on the trace
    ## - `meta.event_count`: the number of honeycomb events on the trace
    ##
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # AddCountsToRoot: false

    ## AddHostMetadataToTrace specifies whether to add host metadata to
    ## traces.
    ##
    ## If `true`, then Refinery will add the following tag to all traces: -
    ## `meta.refinery.local_hostname`: the hostname of the Refinery node
    ##
    ## default: true
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # AddHostMetadataToTrace: true

############
## Traces ##
############
Traces:
  ## Traces contains configuration for how traces are managed.
  ####
    ## SendDelay is the duration to wait after the root span arrives before
    ## sending a trace.
    ##
    ## This setting is a short timer that is triggered when a trace is marked
    ## complete by the arrival of the root span. Refinery waits for this
    ## duration before sending the trace. This setting exists to allow for
    ## asynchronous spans and small network delays to elapse before sending
    ## the trace. `SendDelay` is not applied if the `TraceTimeout` expires or
    ## the `SpanLimit` is reached.
    ##
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "2s".
    ## default: 2s
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # SendDelay: 2s

    ## BatchTimeout is how frequently Refinery sends unfulfilled batches.
    ##
    ## By default, this setting uses the `DefaultBatchTimeout` in `libhoney`
    ## as its value, which is `100ms`.
    ##
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "500ms".
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # BatchTimeout: 500ms

    ## TraceTimeout is the duration to wait before making the trace decision
    ## on an incomplete trace.
    ##
    ## A long timer; it represents the outside boundary of how long to wait
    ## before making the trace decision about an incomplete trace.
    ## Normally trace decisions (send or drop) are made when the root span
    ## arrives. Sometimes the root span never arrives (for example, due to
    ## crashes). Once this timer fires, Refinery will make a trace decision
    ## based on the spans that have arrived so far. This ensures sending a
    ## trace even when the root span never arrives.
    ## After the trace decision has been made, Refinery retains a record of
    ## that decision for a period of time. When additional spans (including
    ## the root span) arrive, they will be kept or dropped based on the
    ## original decision.
    ## If particularly long-lived traces are present in your data, then you
    ## should increase this timer. Note that this increase will also increase
    ## the memory requirements for Refinery.
    ##
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "60s".
    ## default: 60s
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # TraceTimeout: 60s

    ## SpanLimit is the number of spans after which a trace becomes eligible
    ## for a trace decision.
    ##
    ## This setting helps to keep memory usage under control. If a trace has
    ## more than this set number of spans, then it becomes eligible for a
    ## trace decision.
    ## It's most helpful in a situation where a sudden burst of many spans in
    ## a large trace hits Refinery all at once, causing memory usage to spike
    ## and possibly crashing Refinery.
    ##
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # SpanLimit: 0

    ## MaxBatchSize is the maximum number of events to be included in each
    ## batch for sending.
    ##
    ## This value is used to set the `BatchSize` field in the `libhoney`
    ## library used to send data to Honeycomb.
    ## If you have particularly large traces, then you should increase this
    ## value. Note that this will also increase the memory requirements for
    ## Refinery.
    ##
    ## default: 500
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # MaxBatchSize: 500

    ## SendTicker is the interval between checks for traces to send.
    ##
    ## A short timer that determines the duration between trace cache review
    ## runs to send. Increasing this will spend more time processing incoming
    ## events to reduce `incoming_` or `peer_router_dropped` spikes.
    ## Decreasing this will check the trace cache for timeouts more
    ## frequently.
    ##
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "100ms".
    ## default: 100ms
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # SendTicker: 100ms

## Debugging ##
###############
Debugging:
  ## Debugging contains configuration values used when setting up and
  ## debugging Refinery.
  ####
    ## DebugServiceAddr is the IP and port where the debug service runs.
    ##
    ## The debug service is generally only used when debugging Refinery
    ## itself, and will only run if the command line option `-d` is
    ## specified. If this value is not specified, then the debug service runs
    ## on the first open port between `localhost:6060` and `localhost:6069`.
    ##
    ## Should be an ip:port like "localhost:6060".
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # DebugServiceAddr: "localhost:6060"

    ## QueryAuthToken is the token that must be specified to access the
    ## `/query` endpoint. Setting this value via a command line flag may
    ## expose credentials - it is recommended to use the environment variable
    ## or a configuration file.
    ##
    ## This token must be specified with the header
    ## "X-Honeycomb-Refinery-Query" in order for a `/query` request to
    ## succeed. These `/query` requests are intended for debugging Refinery
    ## during setup and are not typically needed in normal operation. If not
    ## specified, then the `/query` endpoints are inaccessible.
    ##
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # QueryAuthToken: "some-private-value"

    ## AdditionalErrorFields is a list of span fields to include when logging
    ## errors happen during the ingestion of events.
    ##
    ## For example, the span too large error. This is primarily useful in
    ## trying to track down misbehaving senders in a large installation. The
    ## fields `dataset`, `apihost`, and `environment` are always included. If
    ## a field is not present in the span, then it will not be present in the
    ## error log.
    ##
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # AdditionalErrorFields:
      # - trace.span_id

    ## DryRun controls whether sampling is applied to incoming traces.
    ##
    ## If enabled, then Refinery marks the traces that would be dropped given
    ## the current sampling rules, and sends all traces regardless of the
    ## sampling decision. This is useful for evaluating sampling rules.
    ## When DryRun is enabled, traces is decorated with `meta.refinery.
    ## dryrun.kept` that is set to `true` or `false`, based on whether the
    ## trace would be kept or dropped. In addition, `SampleRate` will be set
    ## to the incoming rate for all traces, and the field
    ## `meta.refinery.dryrun.sample_rate` will be set to the sample rate that
    ## would have been used.
    ##
    ## Eligible for live reload.

    ## this config file. It also prevents Refinery from using a
    ## publish/subscribe mechanism to propagate peer lists, stress levels,
    ## and configuration changes.
    ## `redis` means that Refinery uses a Publish/Subscribe mechanism,
    ## implemented on Redis, to propagate peer lists, stress levels, and
    ## notification of configuration changes much more quickly than the
    ## legacy mechanism.
    ## The recommended setting is `redis`, especially for new installations.

## Collection Settings ##
#########################
Collection:
  ## Collection contains the settings that are relevant to collecting spans
  ## together to make traces. If none of the memory settings are used, then
  ## Refinery will not attempt to limit its memory usage. This is not
  ## recommended for production use since a burst of traffic could cause
  ## Refinery to run out of memory and crash.
  ##
  ####
    ## CacheCapacity is the number of traces to keep in the cache's circular
    ## buffer.
    ##
    ## The collection cache is used to collect all active spans into traces.
    ## It is organized as a circular buffer. When the buffer wraps around,
    ## Refinery will try a few times to find an empty slot; if it fails, it
    ## starts ejecting traces from the cache earlier than would otherwise be
    ## necessary. Ideally, the size of the cache should be many multiples
    ## (100x to 1000x) of the total number of concurrently active traces
    ## (average trace throughput * average trace duration).
    ##
    ## default: 10000
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # CacheCapacity: 10_000

    ## PeerQueueSize is the maximum number of in-flight spans redirected from
    ## other peers stored in the peer span queue.
    ##
    ## The peer span queue serves as a buffer for spans redirected from other
    ## peers before they are processed. In the event that this queue reaches
    ## its capacity, any subsequent spans will be discarded. The size of this
    ## queue is contingent upon the number of peers within the cluster.
    ## Specifically, with N peers, the queue's span capacity is determined by
    ## (N-1)/N of the total number of spans. Its minimum value should be at
    ## least three times the `CacheCapacity`.
    ##
    ## default: 30000
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # PeerQueueSize: 30_000

    ## IncomingQueueSize is the number of in-flight spans to keep in the
    ## incoming span queue.
    ##
    ## The incoming span queue is used to buffer spans before they are
    ## processed. If this queue fills up, then subsequent spans will be
    ## dropped. Its minimum value should be at least three times the

    ##
    ## default: 30000
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    # IncomingQueueSize: 30_000

    ## AvailableMemory is the amount of system memory available to the
    ## Refinery process.
    ##
    ## This value will typically be set through an environment variable
    ## controlled by the container or deploy script. If this value is zero or
    ## not set, then `MaxMemoryPercentage` cannot be used to calculate the
    ## maximum allocation and `MaxAlloc` will be used instead. If set, then
    ## this must be a memory size. Sizes with standard unit suffixes (such as
    ## `MB` and `GiB`) and Kubernetes units (such as `M` and `Gi`) are
    ## supported. Fractional values with a suffix are supported. If
    ## `AvailableMemory` is set, `Collections.MaxAlloc` must not be defined.

    ##
    ## If nonzero, then it must be an integer value between 1 and 100,
    ## representing the target maximum percentage of memory that should be
    ## allocated by the span collector. If set to a non-zero value, then once
    ## per tick (see `SendTicker`) the collector will compare total allocated
    ## bytes to this calculated value. If allocation is too high, then traces
    ## will be ejected from the cache early to reduce memory. Useful values
    ## for this setting are generally in the range of 70-90.
    ##
    ## default: 75
    ## Eligible for live reload.

    # MaxAlloc: ""

    ## DisableRedistribution controls whether to transmit traces in cache to
    ## remaining peers during cluster scaling event.
    ##
    ## If `true`, Refinery will NOT forward live traces in its cache to the
    ## rest of the peers when peers join or leave the cluster. By disabling
    ## this behavior, it can help to prevent disruptive bursts of network
    ## traffic when large traces with long `TraceTimeout` are redistributed.

    ## ShutdownDelay controls the maximum time Refinery can use while
    ## draining traces at shutdown.
    ##
    ## This setting controls the duration that Refinery expects to have to
    ## drain in-process traces before shutting down an instance. When asked
    ## to shut down gracefully, Refinery stops accepting new spans

###################
## Stress Relief ##
###################
StressRelief:
  ## StressRelief controls the Stress Relief mechanism, which is used to
  ## prevent Refinery from being overwhelmed by a large number of traces.
  ## There is a metric called `stress_level` that is emitted as part of
  ## Refinery metrics. It is a measure of Refinery's throughput rate
  ## relative to its processing rate, combined with the amount of room in
  ## its internal queues, and ranges from `0` to `100`. `stress_level` is
  ## generally expected to be `0` except under heavy load. When stress
  ## levels reach `100`, there is an increased chance that Refinery will
  ## become unstable.
  ## To avoid this problem, the Stress Relief system can do deterministic
  ## sampling on new trace traffic based solely on `TraceID`, without
  ## having to store traces in the cache or take the time processing
  ## sampling rules. Existing traces in flight will be processed normally,
  ## but when Stress Relief is active, trace decisions are made
  ## deterministically on a per-span basis; all spans will be sampled
  ## according to the `SamplingRate` specified here.
  ## Once Stress Relief activates (by exceeding the `ActivationLevel`), it
  ## will not deactivate until `stress_level` falls below the
  ## `DeactivationLevel`. When it deactivates, normal trace decisions are
  ## made -- and any additional spans that arrive for traces that were
  ## active during Stress Relief will respect the decisions made during
  ## that time.
  ## The measurement of stress is a lagging indicator and is highly
  ## dependent on Refinery configuration and scaling. Other configuration
  ## values should be well tuned first, before adjusting the Stress Relief
  ## Activation parameters.
  ## Stress Relief is not a substitute for proper configuration and
  ## scaling, but it can be used as a safety valve to prevent Refinery from
  ## becoming unstable under heavy load.
  ##
  ####
    ## Mode is a string indicating how to use Stress Relief.
    ##
    ## This setting sets the Stress Relief mode.
    ## "never" means that Stress Relief will never activate.

    ## will monitor the status of Refinery and activate according to the
    ## levels set by fields such as `ActivationLevel`.
    ## "always" means that Stress Relief is always on, which may be useful in
    ## an emergency situation.
    ##
    ## default: never
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # Mode: never

    ## ActivationLevel is the `stress_level` (from 0-100) at which Stress
    ## Relief is triggered.
    ##
    ## This value must be greater than `DeactivationLevel` and should be high
    ## enough that it is not reached in normal operation.
    ##
    ## default: 90
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # ActivationLevel: 90

    ## DeactivationLevel is the `stress_level` (from 0-100) at which Stress
    ## Relief is turned off.
    ##
    ## This setting is subject to `MinimumActivationDuration`. The value must
    ## be less than `ActivationLevel`.
    ##
    ## default: 75
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # DeactivationLevel: 75

    ## SamplingRate is the sampling rate to use when Stress Relief is
    ## activated.
    ##
    ## All new traces will be deterministically sampled at this rate based
    ## only on the `traceID`. It should be chosen to be a rate that sends
    ## fewer samples than the average sampling rate Refinery is expected to
    ## generate.
    ## For example, if Refinery is configured to normally sample at a rate of
    ## 1 in 10, then Stress Relief should be configured to sample at a rate
    ## of at least 1 in 30.
    ##
    ## default: 100
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # SamplingRate: 100

    ## MinimumActivationDuration is the minimum time that Stress Relief will
    ## stay enabled once activated.
    ##
    ## This setting helps to prevent oscillations.
    ##
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "10s".
    ## default: 10s
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    # MinimumActivationDuration: 10s
