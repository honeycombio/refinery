# ListenAddr is the IP and port on which to listen for incoming events. Incoming
# traffic is expected to be HTTP, so if using SSL put something like nginx in
# front to do the decryption.
# Should be of the form 0.0.0.0:8080
# Not eligible for live reload.
ListenAddr = "0.0.0.0:8080"

# PeerListenAddr is the IP and port on which to listen for traffic being

# APIKeys is a list of Honeycomb API keys that the proxy will accept. This list
# only applies to events - other Honeycomb API actions will fall through to the
# upstream API directly.
# Adding keys here causes events arriving with API keys not in this list to be
# rejected with an HTTP 401 error If an API key that is a literal '*' is in the

# SendDelay is a short timer that will be triggered when a trace is complete.
# Refinery will wait this duration before actually sending the trace.  The
# reason for this short delay is to allow for small network delays or clock
# jitters to elapse and any final spans to arrive before actually sending the
# trace.  This supports duration strings with supplied units. Set to 0 for
# immediate sends.
# Eligible for live reload.
SendDelay = "2s"

# TraceTimeout is a long timer; it represents the outside boundary of how long
# to wait before sending an incomplete trace. Normally traces are sent when the
# root span arrives. Sometimes the root span never arrives (due to crashes or
# whatever), and this timer will send a trace even without having received the
# root span. If you have particularly long-lived traces you should increase this
# timer. This supports duration strings with supplied units.
# Eligible for live reload.
TraceTimeout = "60s"

# SendTicker is a short timer; it determines the duration to use to check for traces to send
SendTicker = "100ms"

# LoggingLevel is the level above which we should log. Debug is very verbose,

## Implementation Choices ##
############################

# Each of the config options below chooses an implementation of a Refinery
# component to use. Depending on the choice there may be more configuration
# required below in the section for that choice. Changing implementation choices
# requires a process restart; these changes will not be picked up by a live
# config reload. (Individual config options for a given implementation may be
# eligible for live reload).

# Collector describes which collector to use for collecting traces. The only
# current valid option is "InMemCollector".. More can be added by adding
# implementations of the Collector interface.
Collector = "InMemCollector"

# Logger describes which logger to use for Refinery logs. Valid options are
# "logrus" and "honeycomb". The logrus option will write logs to STDOUT and the
# honeycomb option will send them to a Honeycomb dataset.
Logger = "honeycomb"

# Metrics describes which service to use for Refinery metrics. Valid options are
# "prometheus" and "honeycomb". The prometheus option starts a listener that
# will reply to a request for /metrics. The honeycomb option will send summary
# metrics to a Honeycomb dataset.

# [PeerManagement]
# Type = "file"
# Peers is the list of all servers participating in this proxy cluster. Events
# will be sharded evenly across all peers based on the Trace ID. Values here

# Not eligible for live reload.
# RedisHost = "localhost:6379"

# IdentifierInterfaceName is optional. By default, when using RedisHost, Refinery will use
# the local hostname to identify itself to other peers in Redis. If your environment
# requires that you use IPs as identifiers (for example, if peers can't resolve eachother
# by name), you can specify the network interface that Refinery is listening on here.
# Refinery will use the first unicast address that it finds on the specified network
# interface as its identifier.
# Not eligible for live reload.
# IdentifierInterfaceName = "eth0"

# UseIPV6Identifier is optional. If using IdentifierInterfaceName, Refinery will default to the first
# IPv4 unicast address it finds for the specified interface. If UseIPV6Identifier is used, will use
# the first IPV6 unicast address found.
# UseIPV6Identifier = false

# RedisIdentifier is optional. By default, when using RedisHost, Refinery will use
# the local hostname to identify itself to other peers in Redis. If your environment
# requires that you use IPs as identifiers (for example, if peers can't resolve eachother

## In-Memory Collector ##

[InMemCollector]

# The collection cache is used to collect all spans into a trace as well as
# remember the sampling decision for any spans that might come in after the
# trace has been marked "complete" (either by timing out or seeing the root
# span). The number of traces in the cache should be many multiples (100x to
# 1000x) of the total number of concurrently active traces (trace throughput *
# trace duration).
# Eligible for live reload. Growing the cache capacity with a live config reload
# is fine. Avoid shrinking it with a live reload (you can, but it may cause
# temporary odd sampling decisions).
CacheCapacity = 1000

# MaxAlloc is optional. If set, it must be an integer >= 0. 64-bit values are
# supported.
# If set to a non-zero value, once per tick (see SendTicker) the collector
# will compare total allocated bytes to this value. If allocation is too
# high, cache capacity will be reduced and an error will be logged.
# Useful values for this setting are generally in the range of 75%-90% of
# available system memory.
