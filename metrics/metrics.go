// All of the bits in the metrics package are designed to be pluggable. The
// Metrics interface defines the methods that are needed to support it, and all
// of the objects implement them. The general structure is that a MultiMetrics
// object is created, and then one or more of the child objects are added to it.
// The MultiMetrics object will then call the methods on all of the child
// objects. This allows us to support multiple metrics backends at once.
//
// The user can configure which metrics backends are enabled, and which are not.
// The StoreMetrics object is always enabled, and is the first child of the
// MultiMetrics object. This is because we always want StressRelief to be able
// to retrieve metrics data even if the user has not configured any other
// metrics backends.
//
// The MetricsNamer is a helper object that can be used to generate named
// metrics without creating multiple objects. This is so we don't have multiple
// sources writing to the backend at once.
//
// In operation, there is a single MultiMetrics object that is created and then
// named with multiple MetricsNamers. The user's configuration controls how many
// children the MultiMetrics object has, and which ones they are.
//
// The Metrics object supports "constants", which are just float values that can
// be attached to the metrics system. They do not need to be (and should not) be
// registered in advance; they are just a bucket of key-float pairs that can be
// used in combination with other metrics. This is mainly to support
// StressRelief.
