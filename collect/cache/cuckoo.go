// This wraps a cuckoo filter implementation in a way that lets us keep it running forever
// without filling up.
// A cuckoo filter can't be emptied (you can delete individual items if you know what they are,
// but you can't get their names from the filter). Consequently, what we do is keep *two* filters,
// current and future. The current one is the one we use to check against, and when we add, we
// add to both. But the future one is started *after* the current one, so that when the current
// gets too full, we can discard it, replace it with future, and then start a new, empty future.
// This is why the future filter is nil until the current filter reaches .5.
// You must call Maintain() periodically, most likely from a goroutine. The call is cheap,
// and the timing isn't very critical. The effect of going above "capacity" is an increased
// false positive rate and slightly reduced performance, but the filter continues to function.
