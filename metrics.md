# Honeycomb Refinery Metrics Documentation

This document contains the description of various metrics used in Refinery.
It was automatically generated on 2024-10-11 at 16:33:00 UTC.

Note: This document does not include metrics defined in the dynsampler-go dependency, as those metrics are generated dynamically at runtime. As a result, certain metrics may be missing or incomplete in this document, but they will still be available during execution with their full names.

## Metrics with Prefix
This table includes metrics with partially defined names.
Metrics in this table don't contain their expected prefixes. This is because the auto-generator is unable to resolve dynamically created metric names during the generation process.
