          SendDelay is a short timer that will be triggered when a trace is complete.
          Refinery will wait this duration before actually sending the trace.  The
          reason for this short delay is to allow for small network delays or clock
          jitters to elapse and any final spans to arrive before actually sending the
          trace. Set to 0 for immediate sends.

          Sometimes the root span never arrives (due to crashes or whatever),
          and this timer will send a trace even without having received the root
          span. If you have particularly long-lived traces you should increase
          this timer. Note that this will also increase the memory requirements

          AdditionalErrorFields is a list of span fields that should be included
          when logging errors that happen during ingestion of events (for

          `dataset`, `apihost`, and `environment` are always included. If a

          KeptSize controls the number of traces preserved in the cuckoo kept
          traces cache. Refinery keeps a record of each trace that was kept and
          sent to Honeycomb, along with some statistical information. This is
          most useful in cases where the trace was sent before sending the root
          span, so that the root span can be decorated with accurate metadata.
          Default is 10_000 traces (each trace in this cache consumes roughly
          200 bytes). Does not apply to the "legacy" type of cache.

          This cache consumes 4-6 bytes per trace at a scale of millions of traces.
          Changing its size with live reload sets a future limit, but does not have an immediate effect.

          SizeCheckInterval controls the duration of how often the cuckoo cache
          re-evaluates the remaining capacity of its dropped traces cache and
          possibly cycles it.
          This cache is quite resilient so it doesn't need to happen very often,
          but the operation is also inexpensive.
          Default is 10 seconds.

    title: "Stress Relief"
    description: >
      Controls the stress relief mechanism, which is used to prevent
      Refinery from being overwhelmed by a large number of traces.

      There is a metric called stress_level that is emitted as part of refinery
      metrics. It is a measure of refinery's throughput rate relative to its
      processing rate, combined with the amount of room in its internal queues,
      and ranges from 0 to 100. It is generally expected to be 0 except under
      heavy load. When stress levels reach 100, there is an increased chance
      that refinery will become unstable.

      To avoid this problem, the Stress Relief system can do deterministic sampling
      on new trace traffic based solely on TraceID, without having to store traces
      in the cache or take the time processing sampling rules. Existing traces in
      flight will be processed normally, but when Stress Relief is active, trace
      decisions are made deterministically on a per-span basis; all spans will be
      sampled according to the SamplingRate specified here.

      Once Stress Relief activates (by exceeding the ActivationLevel), it will not
      deactivate until stress_level falls below the DeactivationLevel. When it
      deactivates, normal trace decisions are made -- and any additional spans that
      arrive for traces that were active during Stress Relief will respect the
      decisions made during that time.

      The measurement of stress is a lagging indicator and is highly dependent on
      Refinery configuration and scaling. Other configuration values should be well
      tuned first, before adjusting the Stress Relief Activation parameters.

      Stress Relief is not a substitute for proper configuration and scaling, but
      it can be used as a safety valve to prevent Refinery from becoming unstable
      under heavy load.

          Mode is a string indicating how to use Stress Relief. Options are:
          "never" means that Stress Relief will never activate
          "monitor" is the recommended setting, and means that Stress Relief will monitor
              the status of refinery and activate according to the levels set below.
          "always" means that Stress Relief is always on, which may be useful in an
              emergency situation.

        description: >
          SamplingRate is the sampling rate to use when Stress Relief is
          activated. All new traces will be deterministically sampled at this
          rate based only on the traceID. It should be chosen to be a rate that
          sends fewer samples than the average sampling rate Refinery is
          configured to use. For example, if Refinery is configured to normally
          sample at a rate of 1 in 10, then Stress Relief should be configured
          to sample at a rate of at least 1 in 30.

        description: >
          MinimumStartupDuration is used when switching into Monitor mode. When
          stress monitoring is enabled, it will start up in stressed mode for a
          at least this amount of time to try to make sure that Refinery can
          handle the load before it begins processing it in earnest. This is to
          help address the problem of trying to bring a new node into an
          already-overloaded cluster. If this duration is 0, Refinery will not
          start in stressed mode, which will provide faster startup at the
          possible cost of startup instability.
