# Honeycomb Refinery Metrics Documentation

This document contains the description of various metrics used in Refinery.
It was automatically generated {{ now }}.

Note: This document does not include metrics defined in the dynsampler-go dependency, as those metrics are generated dynamically at runtime. As a result, certain metrics may be missing or incomplete in this document, but they will still be available during execution with their full names.

## Complete Metrics
This table includes metrics with fully defined names.

| Name | Type | Unit | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
{{- range .Complete }}
| {{ .Name }} | {{ .Type }} | {{ .Unit }} | {{ .Description }} |
{{- end }}


## Metrics with Prefix
This table includes metrics with partially defined names.
Metrics in this table don't contain their expected prefixes. This is because the auto-generator is unable to resolve dynamically created metric names during the generation process.

| Name | Type | Unit | Description |
|------|------|------|-------------|
{{- range .HasPrefix }}
| {{ .Name }} | {{ .Type }} | {{ .Unit }} | {{ .Description }} |
{{- end }}
