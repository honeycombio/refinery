# Honeycomb Refinery Configuration Documentation

This is the documentation for the configuration file for Honeycomb's Refinery.

## The Config file

The config file is a YAML file.
The file is split into sections; each section is a group of related configuration options.
Each section has a name, and the name is used to refer to the section in other parts of the config file.


## Sample
This is a sample config file:
```yaml
General:
  ConfigurationVersion: 2
Network:
  ListenAddr: "0.0.0.0:8080"
  PeerListenAddr: "0.0.0.0:8081"
OTelMetrics:
  Enabled: true
  APIKey: SetThisToAHoneycombKey
```

The remainder of this document describes the sections within the file and the
fields in each.
