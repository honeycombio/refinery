# Honeycomb Refinery Rules Documentation

This is the documentation for the rules configuration for Honeycomb's Refinery.
It was automatically generated {{ now }}.

## The Rules file

The rules file is a YAML file.
Here is a simple example of a rules file:

```yaml
RulesVersion: 2
Samplers:
    __default__:
        DeterministicSampler:
            SampleRate: 1
    production:
        DynamicSampler:
            SampleRate: 2
            ClearFrequency: 30s
            FieldList:
                - request.method
                - http.target
                - response.status_code
```

Name: `RulesVersion`

This is a required parameter used to verify the version of the rules file.
It must be set to 2.

Name: `Samplers`

Samplers is a mapping of targets to samplers.
Each target is a Honeycomb environment (or, for classic keys, a dataset).
The value is the sampler to use for that target.
The target called `__default__` will be used for any target that is not explicitly listed.
A `__default__` target is required.
The targets are determined by examining the API key used to send the trace.
If the API key is a 'classic' key (which is a 32-character hexadecimal value), the specified dataset name is used as the target.
If the API key is a new-style key (20-23 alphanumeric characters), the key's environment name is used as the target.

The remainder of this document describes the samplers that can be used within the `Samplers` section and the fields that control their behavior.
