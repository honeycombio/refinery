## General Configuration ##
###########################
General:
  ## Contains general configuration options that apply to the entire
  ## refinery process. 
  ####
    ## This file is version 2.
    ## This field is required and must be the first field in the file. It
    ## exists to allow the configuration system to adapt to file format
    ## changes.
    ##  
    ## 
    ## Not eligible for live reload.
    ConfigurationVersion: 2

    ## MinRefineryVersion specifies the lowest Refinery version capable of
    ## loading all of the features used in this file. Refinery will refuse to
    ## start if its version is less than this.

###########################
## Network Configuration ##
###########################
Network:
  ## Contains network configuration options. 
  ####
    ## ListenAddr is the IP and port on which to listen for incoming HTTP
    ## requests. These requests include traffic formatted as Honeycomb
    ## events, proxied requests to the Honeycomb API, and Open Telemetry data
    ## using the http protocol. Incoming traffic is expected to be HTTP, so
    ## if SSL is a requirement, put something like nginx in front to do the
    ## decryption.
    ##  
    ## Should be an ip:port like "0.0.0.0:8080".

  ##  
  ####
    ## ReceiveKeys should be a list of Honeycomb API keys that the proxy will

    ## root spans to indicate the number of child spans on the trace at the
    ## time the sampling decision was made. This value is available to the
    ## rules-based sampler, making it possible to write rules that are
    ## dependent upon the number of spans in the trace. If true, Refinery

Traces:
  ## Configuration for how traces are managed. 
  ####
    ## SendDelay is a short timer that will be triggered when a trace is
    ## complete. Refinery will wait this duration before actually sending the
    ## trace.  The reason for this short delay is to allow for small network
    ## delays or clock jitters to elapse and any final spans to arrive before
    ## actually sending the trace. Set to 0 for immediate sends.
    ##  
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "2s".
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    {{ nonDefaultOnly .Data "SendDelay" "SendDelay" "2s" }}

    ## BatchTimeout dictates how frequently to send unfulfilled batches. By
    ## default this will use the DefaultBatchTimeout in libhoney as its
    ## value, which is 100ms.
    ##  
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "500ms".
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    {{ nonZero .Data "BatchTimeout" "BatchTimeout" "500ms" }}

    ## TraceTimeout is a long timer; it represents the outside boundary of
    ## how long to wait before making the trace decision about an incomplete
    ## trace. Normally traces are sent or dropped when the root span arrives.
    ## Sometimes the root span never arrives (due to crashes or whatever),
    ## and this timer will send a trace even without having received the root
    ## span. If you have particularly long-lived traces you should increase
    ## this timer. Note that this will also increase the memory requirements
    ## for refinery.
    ##  
    ## Accepts a duration string with units, like "60s".
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    {{ nonDefaultOnly .Data "TraceTimeout" "TraceTimeout" "60s" }}

## Debugging ##
###############
Debugging:
  ## Configuration values used when setting up and debugging Refinery. 
  ####
    ## DebugServiceAddr sets the IP and port the debug service will run on.
    ## The debug service is generally only used when debugging Refinery
    ## itself, and will only run if the command line flag -d is specified. If
    ## this value is not specified, the debug service runs on the first open
    ## port between localhost:6060 and :6069.

    ## QueryAuthToken, if specified, provides a token that must be specified
    ## with the header "X-Honeycomb-Refinery-Query" in order for a /query
    ## request to succeed. These /query requests are intended for debugging
    ## refinery during setup and are not typically needed in normal

    ## AdditionalErrorFields is a list of span fields that should be included
    ## when logging errors that happen during ingestion of events (for
    ## example, the span too large error). This is primarily useful in trying
    ## to track down misbehaving senders in a large installation. The fields
    ## `dataset`, `apihost`, and `environment` are always included. If a
    ## field is not present in the span, it will not be present in the error
    ## log.

    {{ renderStringarray .Data "AdditionalErrorFields" "AdditionalErrorFields" "trace.span_id" }}

    ## AddRuleReasonToTrace causes traces that are sent to Honeycomb to
    ## include the field `meta.refinery.reason`. This field contains text
    ## indicating which rule was evaluated that caused the trace to be
    ## included. We recommend enabling this field whenever a rules-based
    ## sampler is in use, as it is useful for debugging and understanding the
    ## behavior of your refinery installation.

## Sample Cache ##
##################

    ## KeptSize controls the number of traces preserved in the cuckoo kept
    ## traces cache. Refinery keeps a record of each trace that was kept and
    ## sent to Honeycomb, along with some statistical information. This is
    ## most useful in cases where the trace was sent before sending the root
    ## span, so that the root span can be decorated with accurate metadata.
    ## Default is 10_000 traces (each trace in this cache consumes roughly
    ## 200 bytes). Does not apply to the "legacy" type of cache.

## Stress Relief ##
###################
StressRelief:
  ## Controls the stress relief mechanism, which is used to prevent
  ## Refinery from being overwhelmed by a large number of traces.
  ## There is a metric called stress_level that is emitted as part of
  ## refinery metrics. It is a measure of refinery's throughput rate
  ## relative to its processing rate, combined with the amount of room in
  ## its internal queues, and ranges from 0 to 100. It is generally
  ## expected to be 0 except under heavy load. When stress levels reach
  ## 100, there is an increased chance that refinery will become unstable.
  ## To avoid this problem, the Stress Relief system can do deterministic
  ## sampling on new trace traffic based solely on TraceID, without having
  ## to store traces in the cache or take the time processing sampling
  ## rules. Existing traces in flight will be processed normally, but when
  ## Stress Relief is active, trace decisions are made deterministically on
  ## a per-span basis; all spans will be sampled according to the
  ## SamplingRate specified here.
  ## Once Stress Relief activates (by exceeding the ActivationLevel), it
  ## will not deactivate until stress_level falls below the
  ## DeactivationLevel. When it deactivates, normal trace decisions are
  ## made -- and any additional spans that arrive for traces that were
  ## active during Stress Relief will respect the decisions made during
  ## that time.
  ## The measurement of stress is a lagging indicator and is highly
  ## dependent on Refinery configuration and scaling. Other configuration
  ## values should be well tuned first, before adjusting the Stress Relief
  ## Activation parameters.
  ## Stress Relief is not a substitute for proper configuration and
  ## scaling, but it can be used as a safety valve to prevent Refinery from
  ## becoming unstable under heavy load.
  ##  
  ####
    ## Mode is a string indicating how to use Stress Relief. Options are:
    ## "never" means that Stress Relief will never activate "monitor" is the
    ## recommended setting, and means that Stress Relief will monitor
    ##     the status of refinery and activate according to the levels set
    ## below.
    ## "always" means that Stress Relief is always on, which may be useful in
    ## an
    ##     emergency situation.

    ## DeactivationLevel is the stress_level (from 0-100) at which Stress
    ## Relief is turned off (subject to MinimumActivationDuration). It must
    ## be less than ActivationLevel.
    ##  
    ## 
    ## Eligible for live reload.
    {{ nonDefaultOnly .Data "DeactivationLevel" "StressRelief.DeactivationLevel" 70 }}

    ## SamplingRate is the sampling rate to use when Stress Relief is
    ## activated. All new traces will be deterministically sampled at this
    ## rate based only on the traceID. It should be chosen to be a rate that
    ## sends fewer samples than the average sampling rate Refinery is
    ## configured to use. For example, if Refinery is configured to normally
    ## sample at a rate of 1 in 10, then Stress Relief should be configured
    ## to sample at a rate of at least 1 in 30.

    ## MinimumActivationDuration is the minimum time that stress relief will

    {{ nonDefaultOnly .Data "MinimumActivationDuration" "StressRelief.MinimumActivationDuration" "10s" }}

    ## MinimumStartupDuration is used when switching into Monitor mode. When
    ## stress monitoring is enabled, it will start up in stressed mode for a
    ## at least this amount of time to try to make sure that Refinery can
    ## handle the load before it begins processing it in earnest. This is to
    ## help address the problem of trying to bring a new node into an
    ## already-overloaded cluster. If this duration is 0, Refinery will not
    ## start in stressed mode, which will provide faster startup at the
    ## possible cost of startup instability.
