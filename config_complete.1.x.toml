## Sample Cache Configuration ##
################################

# Sample Cache Configuration controls the sample cache used to retain information about trace
# status after the sampling decision has been made.

[SampleCacheConfig]

# Type controls the type of sample cache used.
# "legacy" is a strategy where both keep and drop decisions are stored in a circular buffer that is
# 5x the size of the trace cache. This is Refinery's original sample cache strategy.
# "cuckoo" is a strategy where dropped traces are preserved in a "Cuckoo Filter", which can remember
# a much larger number of dropped traces, leaving capacity to retain a much larger number of kept traces.
# It is also more configurable. The cuckoo filter is recommended for most installations.
# Default is "legacy".
# Not eligible for live reload (you cannot change the type of cache with reload).
# Type = "cuckoo"

# KeptSize controls the number of traces preserved in the cuckoo kept traces cache.
# Refinery keeps a record of each trace that was kept and sent to Honeycomb, along with some
# statistical information. This is most useful in cases where the trace was sent before sending
# the root span, so that the root span can be decorated with accurate metadata.
# Default is 10_000 traces (each trace in this cache consumes roughly 200 bytes).
# Does not apply to the "legacy" type of cache.
# Eligible for live reload.
# KeptSize = 10_000

# DroppedSize controls the size of the cuckoo dropped traces cache.
# This cache consumes 4-6 bytes per trace at a scale of millions of traces.
# Changing its size with live reload sets a future limit, but does not have an immediate effect.
# Default is 1_000_000 traces.
# Does not apply to the "legacy" type of cache.
# Eligible for live reload.
# DroppedSize = 1_000_000

# SizeCheckInterval controls the duration of how often the cuckoo cache re-evaluates
# the remaining capacity of its dropped traces cache and possibly cycles it.
# This cache is quite resilient so it doesn't need to happen very often, but the

## Stress Relief Configuration ##
#################################

[StressRelief]

# Controls the parameters of the stress relief system. There is a metric called
# stress_level that is emitted as part of refinery metrics. It is a measure of
# refinery's throughput rate relative to its processing rate, combined with the
# amount of room in its internal queues, and ranges from 0 to 100. It is
# generally expected to be 0 except under heavy load. When stress levels reach
# 100, there is an increased chance that refinery will become unstable.
#
# To avoid this problem, the Stress Relief system can do deterministic sampling
# on new trace traffic based solely on TraceID, without having to store traces
# in the cache or take the time processing sampling rules. Existing traces in
# flight will be processed normally, but when Stress Relief is active, trace
# decisions are made deterministically on a per-span basis; all spans will be
# sampled according to the SamplingRate specified here.
#
# Once Stress Relief activates (by exceeding the ActivationLevel), it will not
# deactivate until stress_level falls below the DeactivationLevel. When it
# deactivates, normal trace decisions are made -- and any additional spans that
# arrive for traces that were active during Stress Relief will respect those
# decisions.
#
# The measurement of stress is a lagging indicator and is highly dependent on
# Refinery configuration and scaling. Other configuration values should be well
# tuned first, before adjusting the Stress Relief Activation parameters.

# Mode is a string indicating how to use Stress Relief. Options are:
# - "never" means that Stress Relief will never activate
# - "monitor" is the recommended setting, and means that Stress Relief will monitor
#     the status of refinery and activate according to the levels set below.
# - "always" means that Stress Relief is always on, which may be useful in an
#     emergency situation.
# Default is "never".
# Eligible for live reload.

# ActivationLevel is the stress_level (from 0-100) at which Stress Relief is
# triggered.
# Default = 75
# Eligible for live reload.

# DeactivationLevel is the stress_level (from 0-100) at which Stress Relief is
# turned off (subject to MinimumActivationDuration). Under normal circumstances,
# it should be well below ActivationLevel to avoid oscillations.
# Default = 25
# Eligible for live reload.
# DeactivationLevel = 25

# StressSamplingRate is the sampling rate to use when Stress Relief is
# activated. All new traces will be deterministically sampled at this rate based
# only on the traceID.
# Default = 100
# Eligible for live reload.

# MinimumActivationDuration is the minimum time that stress relief will stay
# enabled, once activated. This prevents oscillations.

# Eligible for live reload.

# MinimumStartupDuration is used when switching into Monitor mode.
# When stress monitoring is enabled, it will start up in stressed mode for a
# at least this amount of time to try to make sure that Refinery can handle the load
# before it begins processing it in earnest. This is to help address the
# problem of trying to bring a new node into an already-overloaded
# cluster. If this duration is 0, Refinery will not start in stressed mode.
# This can provide faster startup at the possible cost of startup instability.
