`root.` rule feature, and a new metric to track traces dropped by rules.

### Features

- feat: new metric for drops caused by rules (#1047) | [Kent Quirk](https://github.com/kentquirk)

## 2.4.3 2024-03-01

A bug fix release for a regression introduced in the 2.4.2 bug fix release.
It was possible to trigger 500 errors in Refinery's OTLP error responses when sending traces in an unsupported content-type.

### Fixes

- fix: upgrade husky to handle and add tests for invalid content type errors (#1019) | [Mike Goldsmith](https://github.com/MikeGoldsmith) & [Robb Kidd](https://github.com/robbkidd)

## 2.4.2 2024-02-28

This is a bug fix release for returning a improperly formatted OTLP error responses.
OTLP clients receiving the improper response would show errors about parsing the response, masking the error message within the response which complicated solving data send issues.
This release is a recommended upgrade for anyone sending OTLP data to Refinery.

### Fixes

- fix: Bring OTLP HTTP error responses in line with spec. (#1010) | [Tyler Helmuth](https://github.com/TylerHelmuth)

## 2.4.1 2024-02-26

This is a bug fix release for matching fields in the root span context.

### Fixes

The implementation in v2.4.0 can crash if the trace's root span is not present at the time a sampling decision is being made.
Root spans are often not present when the root span is taking longer to complete than the time configured for Refinery to wait for a trace's spans to arrive (`TraceTimeout`).
This release contains a fix for this crash and is a recommended upgrade for anyone using this new feature.
