// We need a Health object that can be used by:
// - internal services to tell it their readiness to receive traffic
// - the router to read back that data for reporting when it receives a health or readiness request
//   either on grpc or on http
// We want that object in its own package so we don't have import cycles

// We register a service with an expected interval for reporting and if it
// doesn't report at all within that interval, we will mark it (and the whole system)
// as unhealthy (not alive). If a system reports not ready, we will mark it as not ready
// and the system as a whole as not ready.

// Services will typically Register during their startup, and then call Ready
// frequently when they are ready to receive traffic. Note that Registration
// does not start the ticker -- it only starts once Ready is called for the
// first time.

// Recorder is the interface used by object that want to record their own health
// status and make it available to the system.

// TickerTime is the interval at which we will check the health of the system.
// We will decrement the counters for each service that has registered.
// If a counter reaches 0, we will mark the service as dead.
// This value should be less than the duration of any reporting timeout in the system.

// The Health object is the main object that services will interact with.
// When services are registered, they will be expected to report in at least once every timeout interval.
