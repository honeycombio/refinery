# This is a demonstration of Refinery's sampler configuration file with
# all possible fields.  It is not intended to be a valid configuration file.
# For more detail on the individual fields, see the documentation in
# rules.md.

# Specify this version of the configuration file format, which is 2.
# This is required.

# Samplers are configured in the Samplers section. The Samplers section
# contains a mapping of environment names (e.g. "production", "staging", etc.)
# to sampler configurations. The environment name is used to select the
# sampler configuration to use for a given trace.  The environment name is
# determined by the API key used to send the trace to Refinery.  If the
# apppropriate environment is not found in the Samplers section, the default sampler
# configuration is used.
# Note that for "classic" environments, the environment names are the dataset
# names instead. See Honeycomb's documentation for more information.
Samplers:
    # The default sampler is used when no other sampler matches.
    # It is required to have a default sampler.
    # The name consists of two underscores on either side of the word "default".
