          where configuration changes are handled by restarting Refinery, which
          is often the case when using Kubernetes, disable this feature with a
          value of `0s`. As of Refinery v2.7, news of a configuration change is
          immediately propagated to all peers, and they will attempt to reload

          Kubernetes ConfigMaps) may cause delays in propagating configuration

        description: >
          A long timer; it represents the outside boundary of how long to wait
          before making the trace decision about an incomplete trace.

          Normally trace decisions (send or drop) are made when the root span
          arrives. Sometimes the root span never arrives (for example, due to
          crashes). Once this timer fires, Refinery will make a trace decision
          based on the spans that have arrived so far. This ensures sending a
          trace even when the root span never arrives.

          After the trace decision has been made, Refinery retains a record of
          that decision for a period of time. When additional spans (including
          the root span) arrive, they will be kept or dropped based on the
          original decision.

          If particularly long-lived traces are present in your data, then you
          should increase this timer. Note that this increase will also
          increase the memory requirements for Refinery.

          This setting helps to keep memory usage under control. If a trace has
          more than this set number of spans, then it becomes eligible for a
          trace decision.

          It's most helpful in a situation where a sudden burst of many spans in
          a large trace hits Refinery all at once, causing memory usage to spike
          and possibly crashing Refinery.

          frequently.

        description: >
          This setting controls how many traces are processed when it is time to
          make a sampling decision. Up to this many traces will be processed every
          `SendTicker` duration. If this number is too small it will mean Refinery
          is spending less time calculating sampling decisions, resulting in data
          arriving at Honeycomb slower.

          If your `collector_collect_loop_duration_ms` is above 3 seconds it is
          recommended to reduce this value and the `SendTicker` duration. This
          will mean Refinery makes fewer sampling decision calculations each
          `SendTicker` tick, but gets the chance to make decisions more often.

        description: >
          If enabled, then Refinery marks the traces that would be dropped
          given the current sampling rules, and sends all traces regardless of
          the sampling decision. This is useful for evaluating sampling rules.

          When DryRun is enabled, traces is decorated with `meta.refinery.
          dryrun.kept` that is set to `true` or `false`, based on whether the
          trace would be kept or dropped. In addition, `SampleRate` will be set
          to the incoming rate for all traces, and the field
          `meta.refinery.dryrun.sample_rate` will be set to the sample rate
          that would have been used.

          NOTE: This setting is not compatible with `TraceCache=distributed`,
          because drop trace decisions shared among peers do not contain all
          the relevant information needed to send traces to Honeycomb.

          The `legacy` strategy uses a simple algorithm that unfortunately
          causes 1/2 of the in-flight traces to be assigned to a different node
          whenever the number of nodes changes. The legacy strategy is
          **deprecated** and is intended to be removed in a future release.

          It is organized as a circular buffer. When the buffer wraps around,
          Refinery will try a few times to find an empty slot; if it fails, it
          starts ejecting traces from the cache earlier than would otherwise be
          necessary. Ideally, the size of the cache should be many
          multiples (100x to 1000x) of the total number of concurrently active
          traces (average trace throughput * average trace duration).

          NOTE: This setting is now deprecated and no longer controls the cache size.

          In the event that this queue reaches its capacity, any subsequent spans will be discarded. The size of this

          This setting controls the duration that Refinery expects to have to
          drain in-process traces before shutting down an instance. When asked

          immediately and drains the remaining traces by sending them to remaining
          peers.

        summary: controls how Refinery handles spans that belong to the same trace in a clustered environment.
        description: >
          When `concentrated`, Refinery will route all spans that belong to the same trace to a single peer. This is the
          default behavior ("Trace Locality") and the way Refinery has worked in the past. When `distributed`, Refinery
          will instead keep spans on the node where they were received, and forward proxy spans that contain only
          the key information needed to make a trace decision. This can reduce the amount of traffic between peers,
          and can help avoid a situation where a single large trace can cause a memory overrun on a single node.

          If `distributed`, the amount of traffic between peers will be reduced, but the amount of traffic between Refinery
          and Redis will significantly increase, because Refinery uses Redis to distribute the trace decisions to all
          nodes in the cluster. It is important to adjust the size of the Redis cluster in this case.

          The total volume of network traffic in `distributed` mode should be expected to decrease unless the cluster size is very large (hundreds of nodes).
          NOTE: This setting is not compatible with `DryRun` when set to `distributed`. See `DryRun` for more information.

          The `HealthCheckTimeout` setting specifies the maximum duration allowed for the health checks of the collection subsystems to complete.

        description: >
          `resize` means that when a cache overrun occurs, the cache is shrunk
          and never grows again, which is generally not helpful unless it
          occurs because of a permanent change in traffic patterns.

          In the `impact` strategy, the items having the most impact on the
          cache size are ejected from the cache earlier than normal but the
          cache is not resized.

          In all cases, it only applies if `MaxAlloc` is nonzero. Default is
          `resize` for compatibility but `impact` is recommended for most
          installations.

          In v2.0, the only available strategy is `impact`, and this setting
          will be removed.

    title: "Stress Relief"
    description: >
      controls the Stress Relief mechanism, which is used to
      prevent Refinery from being overwhelmed by a large number of traces.

      There is a metric called `stress_level` that is emitted as part of
      Refinery metrics. It is a measure of Refinery's throughput rate relative
      to its processing rate, combined with the amount of room in its internal
      queues, and ranges from `0` to `100`. `stress_level` is generally
      expected to be `0` except under heavy load. When stress levels reach
      `100`, there is an increased chance that Refinery will become unstable.

      To avoid this problem, the Stress Relief system can do deterministic
      sampling on new trace traffic based solely on `TraceID`, without having
      to store traces in the cache or take the time processing sampling rules.
      Existing traces in flight will be processed normally, but when Stress
      Relief is active, trace decisions are made deterministically on a
      per-span basis; all spans will be sampled according to the `SamplingRate`
      specified here.

      Once Stress Relief activates (by exceeding the `ActivationLevel`), it
      will not deactivate until `stress_level` falls below the
      `DeactivationLevel`. When it deactivates, normal trace decisions are made
      -- and any additional spans that arrive for traces that were active
      during Stress Relief will respect the decisions made during that time.

      The measurement of stress is a lagging indicator and is highly dependent
      on Refinery configuration and scaling. Other configuration values should
      be well tuned first, before adjusting the Stress Relief Activation
      parameters.

      Stress Relief is not a substitute for proper configuration and scaling,
      but it can be used as a safety valve to prevent Refinery from becoming
      unstable under heavy load.

          node into an already-overloaded cluster.
