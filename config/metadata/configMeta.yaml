        description: >
          When enabled, this setting causes traces that are sent to Honeycomb
          to include the field `meta.refinery.reason`. This field contains text
          indicating which rule was evaluated that caused the trace to be
          included. We recommend enabling this setting whenever a rules-based
          sampler is in use, as it is useful for debugging and understanding
          the behavior of your Refinery installation.

      - name: AddSpanCountToRoot

        description: >
          The added metadata field, `meta.span_count`, indicates
          the number of child spans on the trace at the time the sampling
          decision was made. This value is available to the rules-based sampler,
          making it possible to write rules that are dependent upon the number
          of spans in the trace. If `true`, then Refinery will add `meta.

      - name: SendDelay
        type: duration
        valuetype: nondefault
        default: 2s
        reload: true
        summary: is the duration to wait before sending a trace.
        description: >
          This setting is a short timer that is triggered when a trace is
          complete. Refinery waits for this duration before sending the trace.
          The reason for this setting is to allow for small network delays or
          clock jitters to elapse and any final spans to arrive before sending
          the trace. Set to "0" for immediate sending.

      - name: BatchTimeout
        type: duration
        valuetype: nonzero
        example: 500ms
        reload: true
        summary: is how frequently Refinery sends unfulfilled batches.
        description: >
          By default, this setting uses the `DefaultBatchTimeout` in `libhoney` as its value, which is `100ms`.

      - name: TraceTimeout
        type: duration
        valuetype: nondefault
        default: 60s
        reload: true
        summary: is the duration to wait before making the trace decision on an incomplete trace.
        description: >
          A long timer; it represents the outside boundary of how long to wait
          before making the trace decision about an incomplete trace.

          Normally trace decisions (send or drop) are made when the root span
          arrives. Sometimes the root span never arrives (for example, due to
          crashes) and this timer ensures sending a trace even without having
          received the root span.

          If particularly long-lived traces are present in your data, then you
          should increase this timer. Note that this increase will also
          increase the memory requirements for Refinery.

      - name: MaxBatchSize
        type: int
        valuetype: nondefault
        default: 500
        reload: true
        validations:
          - type: minimum
            arg: 100
        summary: is the maximum number of events to be included in each batch for sending.
        description: >
          This value is used to set the `BatchSize` field in the `libhoney`
          library used to send data to Honeycomb.

          If you have particularly large traces, then you should increase this
          value. Note that this will also increase the memory requirements for
          Refinery.

      - name: SendTicker
        type: duration
        valuetype: nondefault
        default: 100ms
        reload: true
        summary: is the interval between checks for traces to send.
        description: >
          A short timer that determines the duration between trace cache review
          runs to send. Increasing this will spend more time processing incoming
          events to reduce `incoming_` or `peer_router_dropped` spikes.
          Decreasing this will check the trace cache for timeouts more
          frequently.

  - name: Debugging
    title: "Debugging"
    description: contains configuration values used when setting up and debugging Refinery.
    fields:
      - name: DebugServiceAddr

        reload: false
        summary: is the IP and port where the debug service runs.
        description: >
          The debug service is generally only used when debugging Refinery
          itself, and will only run if the command line option `-d` is

        commandline: query-auth-token
        summary: is the token that must be specified to access the `/query` endpoint.
        description: >
          This token must be specified with the header
          "X-Honeycomb-Refinery-Query" in order for a `/query` request to
          succeed. These `/query` requests are intended for debugging Refinery
          during setup and are not typically needed in normal operation. If not
          specified, then the `/query` endpoints are inaccessible.

          trying to track down misbehaving senders in a large installation. The
          fields `dataset`, `apihost`, and `environment` are always included.
          If a field is not present in the span, then it will not be present in
          the error log.

      - name: DryRun
        type: bool
        valuetype: showexample
        default: false
        example: true
        reload: true
        summary: controls whether sampling is applied to incoming traces.
        description: >
          If enabled, then Refinery marks the traces that would be dropped
          given the current sampling rules, and sends all traces regardless of
          the sampling decision. This is useful for evaluating sampling rules.

          When DryRun is enabled, traces is decorated with `meta.refinery.
          dryrun.kept` that is set to `true` or `false`, based on whether the
          trace would be kept or dropped. In addition, `SampleRate` will be set
          to the incoming rate for all traces, and the field
          `meta.refinery.dryrun.sample_rate` will be set to the sample rate
          that would have been used.

          `resize` means that when a cache overrun occurs, the cache is shrunk
          and never grows again, which is generally not helpful unless it
          occurs because of a permanent change in traffic patterns.

          In the `impact` strategy, the items having the most impact on the
          cache size are ejected from the cache earlier than normal but the
          cache is not resized.

          In all cases, it only applies if `MaxAlloc` is nonzero. Default is
          `resize` for compatibility but `impact` is recommended for most
          installations.

          In v2.0, the only available strategy is `impact`, and this setting
          will be removed.

  - name: StressRelief
    title: "Stress Relief"
    description: >
      controls the Stress Relief mechanism, which is used to
      prevent Refinery from being overwhelmed by a large number of traces.

      There is a metric called `stress_level` that is emitted as part of
      Refinery metrics. It is a measure of Refinery's throughput rate relative
      to its processing rate, combined with the amount of room in its internal
      queues, and ranges from `0` to `100`. `stress_level` is generally
      expected to be `0` except under heavy load. When stress levels reach
      `100`, there is an increased chance that Refinery will become unstable.

      To avoid this problem, the Stress Relief system can do deterministic
      sampling on new trace traffic based solely on `TraceID`, without having
      to store traces in the cache or take the time processing sampling rules.
      Existing traces in flight will be processed normally, but when Stress
      Relief is active, trace decisions are made deterministically on a
      per-span basis; all spans will be sampled according to the `SamplingRate`
      specified here.

      Once Stress Relief activates (by exceeding the `ActivationLevel`), it
      will not deactivate until `stress_level` falls below the
      `DeactivationLevel`. When it deactivates, normal trace decisions are made
      -- and any additional spans that arrive for traces that were active
      during Stress Relief will respect the decisions made during that time.

      The measurement of stress is a lagging indicator and is highly dependent
      on Refinery configuration and scaling. Other configuration values should
      be well tuned first, before adjusting the Stress Relief Activation
      parameters.

      Stress Relief is not a substitute for proper configuration and scaling,
      but it can be used as a safety valve to prevent Refinery from becoming
      unstable under heavy load.

          Refinery can handle the load before it begins processing it in
          earnest. This is to help address the problem of trying to bring a new
          node into an already-overloaded cluster.

          If this duration is `0`, then Refinery will not start in stressed
          mode, which will provide faster startup at the possible cost of
          startup instability.
