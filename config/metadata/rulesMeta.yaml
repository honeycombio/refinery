      `Samplers` maps targets to sampler configurations. Each target is a
      Honeycomb environment (or a dataset for Honeycomb Classic keys).
      The value is the sampler to use for that target. A `__default__`
      target is required. The target called `__default__` will be used
      for any target that is not explicitly listed.

      The targets are determined by examining the API key used to send the
      trace. If the API key is a Honeycomb Classic key with a 32-character
      hexadecimal value, then the specified dataset name is used as the target.
      If the API key is a key with 20-23 alphanumeric characters, then
      the key's environment name is used as the target.

      The Deterministic Sampler (`DeterministicSampler`) uses a fixed sample
      rate to sample traces based on their trace ID. This is the simplest
      sampling algorithm - it is a static sample rate, choosing traces randomly
      to either keep or send (at the appropriate rate). It is not influenced by
      the contents of the trace other than the trace ID.

        description: >
          The sample rate to use. It indicates a ratio, where one sample trace
          is kept for every N traces seen. For example, a `SampleRate` of `30`
          will keep 1 out of every 30 traces. The choice on whether to keep any
          specific trace is random, so the rate is approximate.

          The sample rate is calculated from the trace ID, so all spans with the
          same trace ID will be sampled or not sampled together.

          A `SampleRate` of `1` or less will keep all traces.

          Specifying this value is required.

      The Dynamic Sampler (`DynamicSampler`) is the basic Dynamic Sampler
      implementation. Most installations will find the EMA Dynamic Sampler to
      be a better choice. This sampler collects the values of a number of
      fields from a trace and uses them to form a key. This key is handed to
      the standard dynamic sampler algorithm, which generates a sample rate
      based on the frequency with which that key has appeared during the
      previous `ClearFrequency`. See
      https://github.com/honeycombio/dynsampler-go for more detail on the
      mechanics of the Dynamic Sampler. This sampler uses the `AvgSampleRate`
      algorithm from that package.

        description: >
          A list of all the field names to use to form the key that
          will be handed to the Dynamic Sampler. The combination of values from
          all of these fields should reflect how interesting the trace is
          compared to another.

          When choosing field names for `FieldList`, a good field selection
          has consistent values for high-frequency, boring traffic, and
          unique values for outliers and interesting traffic. Including
          an error field, or something like `HTTP status code`, is an
          excellent choice. Using fields with very high cardinality,
          like `k8s.pod.id`, is a bad choice.

          If the combination of fields essentially makes each trace unique,
          then the Dynamic Sampler will sample everything. If the combination
          of fields is not unique enough, then you will not be guaranteed
          samples of the most interesting traces.

          As an example, consider as a good set of fields: the combination of
          `HTTP endpoint` (high-frequency and boring), `HTTP method`, and
          `status code` (normally boring but can become interesting when
          indicating an error) since it will allowing proper sampling of
          all endpoints under normal traffic and call out when there is
          failing traffic to any endpoint.

          In contrast, for example, consider as a bad set of fields: a
          combination of `HTTP endpoint`, `status code`, and `pod id`, since it
          would result in keys that are all unique, and therefore result in
          sampling 100% of traces.

          For example, rather than a set of fields, using only the `HTTP
          endpoint` field is a **bad** choice, as it is not unique enough, and
          therefore interesting traces, like traces that experienced a `500`,
          might not be sampled. Field names may come from any span in the
          trace; if they occur on multiple spans, then all unique values will
          be included in the key.

          Once `MaxKeys` is reached, new keys will not be included in the sample
          rate map, but existing keys will continue to be be counted. Use this
          field to keep the sample rate map size under control. Defaults to
          `500`; Dynamic Samplers will rarely achieve their sampling goals with
          more keys than this.

          are normally small variations in trace length, we recommend setting
          this field to `false` (the default). If your traces are consistent
          lengths and changes in trace length is a useful indicator to view in

      The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Dynamic Sampler
      (`EMADynamicSampler`) attempts to average a given sample rate, weighting
      rare traffic and frequent traffic differently so as to end up with the
      correct average.

      `EMADynamicSampler` is an improvement upon the simple `DynamicSampler`
      and is recommended for many use cases. Based on the `DynamicSampler`,
      `EMADynamicSampler` differs in that rather than compute rate based on a
      periodic sample of traffic, it maintains an Exponential Moving Average of
      counts seen per key, and adjusts this average at regular intervals. The
      weight applied to more recent intervals is defined by `weight`, a number
      between (0, 1). Larger values weight the average more toward recent
      observations. In other words, a larger weight will cause sample rates more
      quickly adapt to traffic patterns, while a smaller weight will result in
      sample rates that are less sensitive to bursts or drops in traffic and
      thus more consistent over time.

      Keys that are not already present in the EMA will always have a sample
      rate of `1`. Keys that occur more frequently will be sampled on a
      logarithmic curve. Every key will be represented at least once in any
      given window and more frequent keys will have their sample rate increased
      proportionally to trend towards the goal sample rate.

          The EMA of any key will approach `0` if it is not repeatedly observed,

          constitutes "zero". Keys with averages below this threshold will be
          removed from the EMA. Default is the value of `Weight`, as this
          prevents a key with the smallest integer value (1) from being aged

      The `EMAThroughputSampler` is an improvement upon the Total Throughput
      Sampler and is recommended for most throughput-based use cases. Because it

    description: >
      Windowed Throughput Sampler (`WindowedThroughputSampler`) is an enhanced
      version of total throughput sampling. Just like the `TotalThroughput`
      Sampler, `WindowedThroughputSampler` attempts to meet the goal of fixed
      number of events per second sent to Honeycomb.

      The original throughput sampler updates the sampling rate every
      "ClearFrequency" seconds. While this parameter is configurable, it suffers
      from the following tradeoff:
        - Decreasing it is more responsive to load spikes, but with the
        cost of making the sampling decision on less data.
        - Increasing it is less responsive to load spikes, but sample rates
        will be more stable because they are made with more data.

      The Windowed Throughput Sampler resolves this by introducing two
      different, tunable parameters:
        - `UpdateFrequency`: how often the sampling rate is recomputed
        - `LookbackFrequency`: how much total time is considered when
        recomputing sampling rate.

      A standard configuration would be to set `UpdateFrequency` to `1s` and
      `LookbackFrequency` to `30s`. In this configuration, for every second, we
      lookback at the last 30 seconds of data in order to compute the new
      sampling rate. The actual sampling rate computation is nearly identical to
      the original Throughput Sampler, but this variant has better support for
      floating point numbers and does a better job with less-common keys.

      If your key space is sharded across different servers, then this is a good
      method for making sure each server sends roughly the same volume of
      content to Honeycomb. It performs poorly when the active keyspace is very
      large.

      `GoalThroughputPerSec` * `ClearFrequency` defines the upper
      limit of the number of keys that can be reported and stay under the goal,
      but with that many keys, you'll only get one event per key per
      `ClearFrequencySec`, which is very coarse. Aim for at least 1 event per
      key per sec to 1 event per key per 10sec to get reasonable data.
      In other words, the number of active keys should be less than

    description: >
      The Rules-based sampler allows you to specify a set of rules that will
      determine whether a trace should be sampled or not. Rules are evaluated in
      order, and the first rule that matches will be used to determine the
      sample rate. If no rules match, then the `SampleRate` defaults to `1` and
      all traces will be kept.

      Rules-based samplers will usually be configured to have the last rule be a
      default rule with no conditions that uses a downstream Dynamic Sampler to
      keep overall sample rate under control.

          Indicates whether to expand nested JSON when evaluating rules. If
          false (the default), nested JSON will be treated as a string. If
          `true`, nested JSON will be expanded into a `map[string]interface{}`
          and the value of the field will be the value of the nested field. For
          example, if you have a field called `http.request.headers` and you
          want to check the value of the `User-Agent` header, then you would set
          this to `true` and use `http.request.headers.User-Agent` as the field
          name in your rule. This is a computationally expensive option and may
          cause performance problems if you have a large number of spans with
          nested JSON.

          The field to check. This can name any field in the trace. If the field
          is not present, then the condition will not match. The comparison is
          case-sensitive.

          The field can also include a prefix that changes the span used for evaluation of the field.
          The only prefix currently supported is `root`, as in `root.http.status`. Specifying `root.`
          causes the condition to be evaluated against the root span.

          For example, if the `Field` is `root.url`, then the condition will be processed using the url
          field from the root span.

          The setting `Scope: span` for a rule does not change the meaning of this prefix --
          the condition is still evaluated on the root span and is treated as if it were part of the
          span being processed.

          When using the `root.` prefix on a field with a `not-exists` operator, include the `has-root-span: true` condition in the rule.
          The `not-exists` condition on a `root.`-prefixed field will evaluate to false if the existence of the root span is not checked and the root span does not exist.
          The primary reason a root span is not present on a trace when a sampling decision is being made is when the root span takes longer to complete than the configured TraceTimeout.

          will result in the comparison evaluating to `false`. This is
          especially useful when a field like `http status code` may be
          rendered as strings by some environments and as numbers or booleans
          by others.

          The best practice is to always specify `Datatype`; this avoids
          ambiguity, allows for more accurate comparisons, and offers a
          minor performance improvement.
