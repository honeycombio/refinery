// Spec for the central store's internal behavior:
//
// * Refinery registers itself with a unique ID with the central store on startup; central store records
//   that ID. All transactions to the store include the ID, which allows the store to record and attribute
// 	 all the actions (for telemetry and debugging).
// * As spans are written to the interface, they get queued up and sent to the central store in batches.
// * The store organizes spans into traces, and maintains state information for each trace.
//
// The states are as follows:
// * Collecting: the trace is still being collected; spans are being added to it. This is the initial state of a trace
// when it is first seen (unless the trace includes the root span on the first request, in which case it will start in WaitingToDecide).
// * DecisionDelay: either the trace timeout has expired or the root span has arrived, and is in the delay period before making a decision.
// * ReadyForDecision — The DecisionDelay timeout has expired and the trace has been assigned to a refinery for a decision.
//   Any trace in this state beyond a maximum times out and reassigns to a different refinery.
// * AwaitingDecision — A refinery has requested the trace and should return with the actual decision.
//   If a timeout expires the trace is returned to ReadyForDecision and assigned to a different refinery; any decision received
//   from the non-owning refinery after the timeout is ignored.
// * Decision:Keep — this decision has been received from the refinery, and moves to a state that includes recorded trace metadata and sample rate information
// * Decision:Drop — this decision forgets all trace information except the traceID (we typically use something like a Bloom filter to track it)

// We expect a remote store to collect spans and manage the state of traces.
// Data structures it has to provide:
// - a list of spans for a trace
// - a record of the state of a trace and its metadata (span count, etc)
//
// It should be able to:
// - receive a span and add it to the appropriate trace, creating the trace if necessary
// - count spans and metadata about them
// - return the entire state of an individual trace
// - return the IDs of traces in a given state (e.g. "WaitingToDecide")
// - move a trace atomically from one state to another
// - return the IDs of traces that have been in a given state for a given time
// - return metrics about the traces it has seen
